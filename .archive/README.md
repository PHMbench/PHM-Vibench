## 🎯 Purpose

This archive maintains historical context while keeping the active project directory focused on current, relevant documentation. All archived files remain accessible but don't clutter the main workspace.

## 📋 Archive Policy

Files are archived when they are:
- Historical reports from completed phases
- Superseded by newer, more comprehensive versions
- Duplicate information available in consolidated formats
- No longer actively referenced in current workflows

Files are permanently removed when they are:
- Exact duplicates with no additional value
- Intermediate analysis files with consolidated final versions available
- Redundant CSV files when Excel/Markdown versions exist with same data
