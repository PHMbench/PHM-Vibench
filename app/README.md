# App Module

This directory contains a Streamlit interface for running PHM-Vibench pipelines.
The web UI guides users through loading metadata, configuring parameters and
starting experiments. Terminal output is streamed in real time and the process
can be paused or resumed.

Run the application with:

```bash
streamlit run app/gui.py
```
