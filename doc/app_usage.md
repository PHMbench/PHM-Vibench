# GUI Usage

A Streamlit application is provided in `app/gui.py`. The interface streams
process output and allows pausing/resuming the run. Parameters for the data,
model, task and trainer are organized in expandable sections, each with an
"Update" button to confirm changes.


Launch the GUI with:

```bash
streamlit run app/gui.py
```
