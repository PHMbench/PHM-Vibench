## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please report it to us privately. **Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to [INSERT SECURITY CONTACT EMAIL ADDRESS HERE].

Please include the following details with your report:

* A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
* Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
* Any proof-of-concept code or examples.
* Information about the affected versions.

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report as soon as possible, typically within 48 hours, and will work with you to understand and address the issue. We aim to provide an initial assessment of the vulnerability's severity and a plan for remediation within 7 days.

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will credit you for the discovery if you wish, once the vulnerability has been addressed.
